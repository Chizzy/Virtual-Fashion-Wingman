# Virtual-Style-Wingman

## Overview

For project #2, I created a full-stack application using Mongoose, Express, Handlebars, and Node.js.

Virtual Style Wingman is the go-to place for someone who have the worst fashion sense amongst their friends. A user can sign-up and decide whether they are the one seeking style advice or the one giving style advice. The user seeking style advice can upload an image of their outfit with some context about the outfit itself and where they are going with the outfit. The user giving style advice can leave some feedback on the post telling the other user what they can do to improve their outfit.
